## [Unreleased]

This release is a major change since the last version as it updates the ICU4X dependency from 1.x to 2.x. Take a look at the [migration guide](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/migration/).

### Added

- [`fmt`](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/fmt) is now the main function to format dates, times, datetimes, and timezones. It's more expressive than the old individual functions.
- `zone-styles`, `alignment`, `fields`, `length`, `time-precision`, and `year-style` contain the supported values for arguments to `fmt`. Their values are _not_ implementation defined meaning you can rely on their string values.
- There is now a new [experimental pattern API](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/fmt/#experimental-pattern).

### Changed

- The minimum Typst compiler version is now 0.13.0.

### Removed

- `fmt-date`, `fmt-datetime`, `fmt-time`, and `experimental.fmt-{timezone, zoned-datetime}` are replaced by `fmt`

## [0.1.2] - 2024-06-13

### Added

- The documentation is now hosted at [nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/) and includes more examples.
- The [`offset`](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/v0.1.2/fmt-timezone/#offset) in time zones can be specified as an `int` which specifies the offset in seconds.
- ðŸš§ [`fmt-zoned-datetime`](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/v0.1.2/fmt-zoned-datetime): `date-length` and `time-length` now accept `none`.

### Changed

- ðŸš§ [`fmt-timezone`](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/v0.1.2/fmt-timezone): `includes` was renamed to `format` and doesn't accept an array anymore (passing an array with more than one item never worked).
- ðŸš§ [`fmt-timezone`](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/v0.1.2/fmt-timezone): The `-format` suffix for options of [`format`](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/v0.1.2/fmt-timezone#format) was removed.
- ðŸš§ [`fmt-timezone`](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/v0.1.2/fmt-timezone): `local-date` now accepts dictionaries and datetimes without `hour`, `minute`, and `second` (default to `0`) to be able to use `datetime.today()`.

### Fixed

- Setting [`bcp47`](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/v0.1.2/fmt-timezone/#bcp47) in time zones now works correctly.
- Setting [`metazone-id`](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/v0.1.2/fmt-timezone/#metazone-id) in time zones now works correctly.

## [0.1.1] - 2024-06-05

### Added

- `locale-info` - This function gets information about a locale identifier and how it was parsed.
- This changelog was added.

### Changed

- ðŸš§ `fmt-timezone`: `offset` is now a named (but required) parameter to be more in sync with `fmt-zoned-datetime` (see example).
- Updated README to show more locales.

### Fixed

- Removed redundant `bytes()` call

## [0.1.0] - 2024-05-31

### Added

- `fmt-date`
- `fmt-time`
- `fmt-datetime`
- `fmt-timezone` (ðŸš§ experimental)
- `fmt-zoned-datetime` (ðŸš§ experimental)
